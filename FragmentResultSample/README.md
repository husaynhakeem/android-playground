# Passing data between Fragments

Android sample app to learn about passing data between fragments using the new [FragmentResultOwner](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/fragment/app/FragmentResultOwner) APIs. It mainly showcases:
- Passing data between 2 distinct Fragments.
- Passing data between a child fragment and its parent.
- Testing that data is correctly passed between fragments using [FragmentScenario](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/fragment/app/testing/FragmentScenario).

This sample follows this [documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/pass-data-between).
