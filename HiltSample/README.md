Android sample app to learn about dependency injection in Android using Hilt. 

![alt text](https://github.com/husaynhakeem/android-playground/blob/hilt/HiltSample/art/art.png)

It mainly showcases:
- Field injection
- Scoping instances to containers
- Hilt Modules
- Adding bindings with @Provides and @Binds
- Qualifiers

There wasn't much documentation around testing with Hilt. I might add it in the future.
