# View Binding

Android sample app to learn about view binding in Android. It mainly showcases:
- Enabling view binding through the app's build file.
- Setting up binding instances in activities.
- Setting up binding instances in Fragments using both the `inflate(LayoutInflater)` and `bind(View)` static methods.
- Accessing and interacting with views through the binding instances.
- Setting up layout files differently for different configurations, and accessing them through the binding instances with their nullable references.
