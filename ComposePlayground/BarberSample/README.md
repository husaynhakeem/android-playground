## Learnings
Some learnings from this exercise include:
- Building an `AutoFitText` composable that sizes its content (text) to fit within a max number of lines.
- Using the `Canvas` composable api to draw an icon.
- Using the `Scaffold` composable to render a screen with a top app bar and a bottom navigation bar.
- Navigating between composables.
